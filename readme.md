# WordSmith - Decentralized Blockchain Word Game

WordSmith is a decentralized blockchain-powered word-guessing game where players use **TheMythicToken ($TMT$)** to guess mystery words. Only vowels are initially visible, and players must deduce the word within five attempts. Correct guesses reward players with tokens, while wrong guesses add to the challenge. Built on blockchain technology, WordSmith ensures transparency, fairness, and secure token management.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess words with only vowels revealed.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Game logic secured via a smart contract.
- **Token Rewards**: Earn $TMT$ tokens for correct guesses.
- **Decentralized**: All game operations are transparent and stored on the blockchain.
